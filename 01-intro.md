---
## Content Organization

The course content is divided into four **tracks** based on the study method and scope.

---

## Tracks

- **T1: Active Learning**
  - Focused exercises with automated tests.

- **T2: Active Learning**
  - Simulation-based programming of ideal noise-free robots.

- **T3: Active Learning**
  - Programming of non-ideal robots (realistic simulation or real-world robot).

- **T4: Reflective Learning**
  - Weekly reflection on personal study process and feedback.

---

## Team-Based Learning

- **T1-T3** tasks are designed to be solved in **teams of two**.
- **T4** reflection and feedback tasks are individual.

---

## Teams

- Teams are self-formed.
- Each team should have **different teammates** for every major task (i.e., shapes, colors, and maze).
  - Promotes diverse teamwork experience and collaboration with new people.
  - 3 teams over the semester.

---

## T1 (Track 1)

- Tasks **EX01 to EX10** are equipped with automated tests.
- Worth approximately **23%** of total points.

---

## T2 (Track 2)

- Simulation-based programming of ideal, noise-free robots.
- Worth approximately **57%** of total points.

---

## T3 (Track 3)

- Programming of non-ideal robots (realistic simulation or real-world robot).
- Worth approximately **18%** of total points.

---

## T4 (Track 4)

- Self-reflection every week.
- The goal is to help you identify problems and improve your personal and overall learning process.
- Also serves as a feedback system for the teaching team.
- As an extra incentive, every reflection awards 1 point (0.1% of total points, 1.6% for 16 weeks).
- One overall course reflection at the end of the semester.

---

## Tracks Overview

- **T1**: 22.9% (10 tasks, total 235 points).
- **T2**: 56.6% (main focus, total 580 points).
- **T3**: 18.1% (extensions to T3, total 185 points).
- **T4**: 2.4% (16 tasks × 1 points + 9 points = 24 points).
- Feedback + reflection: maximum 15 × 2 + 9 = 39 points.

**Total**: 24 + 235 + 580 + 185 = **1024 points**.

---

## T3: Real-World Challenges

- Real-world T3 tasks are often harder but also fully "realistic."

---

## Why Does T3 Earn Fewer Points Despite Being Harder?

1. **Lab time limitations** prevent allocating a higher weight to T3 in credit calculations.
2. The course is designed for computer science students, with an emphasis on programming solutions rather than hardware related problem-solving.
3. Once T2 tasks are solved with correct techniques, T3 tasks require less time (especially in simulation).

---

## Lab Time Breakdown for T3

\[
{{((1.5+3)/2) \times 16}\over{6 \times 26}} = 0.2308 \approx 23\%
\]

Lab time also includes defending the tasks, leaving even less time for testing.

---

## Process

**T1 → T2 → T3 → T4**

- **T1**: Develops required components.
- **T2**: Applies T1 components to larger tasks.
- **T3**: Adds noise filters and other features to T2 tasks.
- **T4**: Aids knowledge consolidation and improves the learning process.

---

## Assessment

A **traditional point-based system**.

---

## Grading Scale

- **5 (Excellent)**: 90.1%+ (901+ points).
- **4 (Very Good)**: 80.1%–90.0% (801–900 points).
- **3 (Good)**: 70.1%–80.0% (701–800 points).
- **2 (Satisfactory)**: 60.1%–70.0% (601–700 points).
- **1 (Poor)**: 50.1%–60.0% (501–600 points).
- **0 (Fail)**: Below 50.1% (<501 points).

---

## T2-T3 Tasks

1. **Shapes (S)**: 4 weeks.
2. **Colors (C)**: 5 weeks.
3. **Maze (M)**: 6 weeks.

---

## Shapes

- **Level 1**: The robot detects an object and moves toward it.
- **Level 2**: The robot iteratively detects objects and alternates between approaching the closest and the farthest object.
- **Level 3**: The robot positions itself to form an equilateral triangle with two objects.

---

## Colors

- **Level 1**: The robot finds the blue object and moves toward it.
- **Level 2**: The robot iteratively detects objects and alternates between approaching the closest and the farthest blue object.
- **Level 3**: Robot forms a rectangle with three objects.

---

## Maze

- **Level 1**: Robot exits a maze consisting of U-turns.
- **Level 2**: Robot exits a random maze.
- **Level 3**: Robot fully maps the maze and exits it.
- **Level 4**: Robot fully maps the maze, is moved to a random place, and moves to a pre-determined corner.

---

## Task Defense

- T1–T3 tasks must be presented and defended in teams.
- Both team members must be present.

---

## Lab Sessions

- Individual feedback is crucial!
- Be active and ask questions!

---
